Big data architectures like Hadoop and Spark solve the distributed database problem, but assume your code is written in Java or another JVM-based language like Scala. However, data science, predictive analytics, and machine learning don\u2019t happen in JVM-based languages\u2014they happen in Python, R, and, to a lesser extent, C\/C++. Furthermore, all the major players like AWS, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Red Hat, and Docker are lined up behind Kubernetes. Containers and Kubernetes make great language-agnostic distributed computing clusters, as it is just as easy to deploy Python as it is Java.
