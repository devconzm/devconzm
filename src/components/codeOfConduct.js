            DevCon Zambia strives on being a healthy community! Part of being a community is to set standards on how we
            make our events and surrounding communication an inclusive, judgement and harassment-free place for
            individuals regardless of background or experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to make sure that our community is a safe place to learn, connect, and grow together. This Code of
            Conduct applies to all events run by DevCon Zambia, including any self-organised events derived from our
            events. We also expect the same code of conduct to carry through to any other medium that relates to DevCon
            Zambia, for example, social media, blogs, forums and chat services.

          <div className="be-kind-paragraph">
            <p>
              Approach any interaction with consideration. Communication and discussions should be friendly and
              welcoming and not exclusive to anyone of different backgrounds, experience, or opinion.

            <p>
              Poor manners and attitude are never an excuse. Always treat others with the most utmost respect, and be
              welcoming to everyone. Do not speak ill of others in any environment or situation.

            <li>
              ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ (because these things don’t

        <h4>Diversity Policy</h4>
        <div className="diversity-paragraph">
          <p>
            Diversity and self-expression are essential. Therefore, we encourage all attendees to identify and express
            how they wish, including the use of any facilities they feel most comfortable in, regardless of gender
            expression. Please do not question someones use of facilities, as they know and are conscious of where they
            are. If you witness someone being made to feel unwelcome, or someone makes you feel unwelcome while using
            any facilities, please reach out to a conference staff member so we can assist you.
